On Mac OS, had issue with SourceTree always asking me for my password when pushing a commit.
Found solution on: https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/SourceTree-on-Mac-OS-does-not-remember-password/qaq-p/199910

Specifically, in the terminal I typed in:
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

```sh
import numpy as np
```
